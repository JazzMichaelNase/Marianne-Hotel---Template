# Hotel System GitHub Repository

## Introduction

Greetings and welcome to the GitHub repository for our Hotel System project! This project was developed during our third year pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science, and we are excited to share the code with the wider programming community.

## Important Notes

Please be aware that the codes shared here are templates. We have removed personal information and intricate details of our backend functionalities for privacy and security reasons.

Additionally, the `composer.json` file has been intentionally removed to honor and give credit to its original author and creator. If you choose to use this template, we encourage you to diligently search for and credit the composer appropriately. Understanding and implementing it correctly will ensure a seamless integration into your project.

## Contribution and Acknowledgment

While this resource is freely offered, acknowledgment serves as a token of appreciation for our collaborative efforts. It encourages us to continue sharing knowledge to assist fellow programmers in their educational journey on system development.

## Learning Opportunities

We urge users to explore and learn from this project. Deliberately, certain errors have been incorporated, providing learning opportunities that require hands-on experience to identify and rectify. Embracing these challenges will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of programming concepts.

## Gratitude

A sincere expression of gratitude goes out to all those who contributed to the realization of this project. Your support has been invaluable, and we extend our thanks to everyone who aided us in bringing this project to fruition.

Thank you for visiting our repository and best of luck with your programming endeavors!
