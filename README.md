Greetings and welcome to my inaugural GitHub project! In this endeavor, 
I am pleased to present our Hotel System, 
developed during our third year pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science.

The codes shared here were integral to our presentation, 
and we are enthusiastic about making them accessible to the wider programming community. 
However, it's essential to note that these codes are templates. 
Personal information and intricate details of our backend functionalities have been omitted for privacy and security reasons.

Furthermore, I have intentionally removed the `composer.json` file to honor and give credit to its original author and creator. 
Should you choose to utilize this template, we encourage you to diligently search for and credit the composer appropriately. 
Taking the time to understand and implement it correctly will ensure a seamless integration into your project.

While this resource is offered freely, 
acknowledgment serves as a token of appreciation for our collaborative efforts and encourages us 
to continue sharing knowledge to assist fellow programmers in their educational journey on system development.

I would like to emphasize the importance of exploring and learning from this project. 
Deliberately, I have incorporated certain errors that necessitate learning and hands-on experience to identify and rectify. 
I suggest that future or current programmers embrace the opportunity to delve into these challenges, 
as overcoming them will undoubtedly contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of programming concepts.

A sincere expression of gratitude goes out to all those who contributed to the realization of this project. 
Your support has been invaluable, and we extend our thanks to everyone who aided us in bringing this project to fruition.
